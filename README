NAME
    POE::Component::SmokeBox::Uploads::NNTP - Obtain uploaded CPAN modules
    via NNTP.

SYNOPSIS
      use strict;
      use POE qw(Component::SmokeBox::Uploads::NNTP);

      $|=1;

      POE::Session->create(
            package_states => [
              'main' => [qw(_start upload)],
            ],
      );

      $poe_kernel->run();
      exit 0;

      sub _start {
        POE::Component::SmokeBox::Uploads::NNTP->spawn(
            event => 'upload',
        );
        return;
      }

      sub upload {
        print $_[ARG0], "\n";
        return;
      }

DESCRIPTION
    POE::Component::SmokeBox::Uploads::NNTP is a POE component that alerts
    newly uploaded CPAN distributions. It obtains this information from
    polling an NNTP server ( by default the "perl.cpan.uploads" group on
    "nntp.perl.org" ).

    POE::Component::Client::NNTP is used to handle the interaction with the
    NNTP server.

CONSTRUCTOR
    spawn
        Takes a number of parameters:

          'event', the event handler in your session where each new upload alert should be sent, mandatory;
          'session', optional if the poco is spawned from within another session;

        The 'session' parameter is only required if you wish the output
        event to go to a different session than the calling session, or if
        you have spawned the poco outside of a session.

        Returns an object.

METHODS
    session_id
        Returns the POE::Session ID of the component.

    shutdown
        Terminates the component.

INPUT EVENTS
    shutdown
        Terminates the component.

OUTPUT EVENTS
    An event will be triggered for each new CPAN upload. The event will have
    ARG0 set to the path of the upload:

      B/BI/BINGOS/POE-Component-SmokeBox-Uploads-NNTP-0.01.tar.gz

    Suitable for feeding to the smoke tester of your choice.
